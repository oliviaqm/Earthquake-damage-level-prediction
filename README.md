# Earthquake-damage-level-prediction
Create an ML model to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal and make the model deployable. 

The data was collected through surveys by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics, which works under the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal. This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.
Courtesy goes to the DrivenData Competitions platform for making the data accessible to the public.
